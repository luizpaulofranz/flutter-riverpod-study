# Riverpod Ecommerce

A simple Riverpod study project to understand state management with Riverpod and code generation.

## Getting Started

This project uses **Riverpod with code generation** for state management. Before running the app, you need to generate the necessary code files.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.32.8 or higher
- Dart 3.8.1 or higher

### Setup Instructions

1. **Generate Code**: First, run the build runner to generate the necessary Riverpod code:
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. **Run the App**: After code generation is complete, you can run the app normally:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Project Purpose

This project is designed to help understand how to use Riverpod for state management in Flutter applications. The codebase includes educational comments throughout the app to explain Riverpod concepts and best practices.

### Built With

- **Flutter**: 3.32.8
- **Dart**: 3.8.1
